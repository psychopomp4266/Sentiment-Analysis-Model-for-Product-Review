- The folder contains the initial Model with the dataset as well as jupyter notebook code. It was trained on smaller dataset and predicted only Positive and Negative Sentiments.
- The current model is under enhancement by using Word Embeddings from GloVe and Larger Datasets like Amazon/Flipkart Reviews and other available freely on Kaggle.
Deeper Neural Network with RNNs, Batch Normalization, and Drouput Layers among others are being incorporated into the model.
